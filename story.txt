Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Goldilocks. 
She went for a walk in the forest. 
Pretty soon, she came upon a house. 
She knocked and, when no one answered, she walked right in.
At the table in the kitchen, there were three bowls of porridge. 
Goldilocks was hungry. 
She tasted the porridge from the first bowl.
"This porridge is too hot!" she exclaimed.
Then she went to try the second bowl of porridge. 
"Yuck! This porridge is too cold," she said. 
Finally, she tried the third bowl of porridge. 
"Yum, this porridge is just right!" she said happily. 
Goldilocks went to explore the rest of the house and came across a bedroom. 
She jumped on the biggest bed.
"Ouch! This bed is too hard" she yelled.
